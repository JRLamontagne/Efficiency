# Efficiency
Implementation of various improved efficiency statistics for skewed and periodic data

Python and R scripts implementing various efficiency estimators as defined in Lamontagne et al. (in Review), including:
    LBE
    LBE’
    NSE
    KGE
    LNSE
    PVSE

Also implemented are mixture estimators for LBE and LBE’:
	  LBEm
	  LBE’m
The Python script has been tested on large datasets.  The R script is still in development.
Repository is still under development and will be updated periodically.
